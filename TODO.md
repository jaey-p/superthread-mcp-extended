- need to attach available list id for board being accessed in the mcp response, so claude doesnt make a new list. 
- double check the data being passed to claude and if it's adequete.
- might need to add two calls when one mcp is called.
- might need to enable some sort of caching to avoid making too many calls. (huge maybe)
