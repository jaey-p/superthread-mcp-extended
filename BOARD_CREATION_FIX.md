# Board Creation 403 Error - Investigation & Fix

## Problem

The `create_board` tool was returning a 403 "no access to resource" error when attempting to create new boards.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Steps

1. **API Documentation Review**: Examined official Superthread API documentation
2. **Endpoint Verification**: Confirmed correct endpoint format: `https://api.superthread.com/v1/{team_id}/boards`
3. **Request Payload Analysis**: Identified field requirements discrepancy

### Key Findings

- **Endpoint**: ✅ Correct - `POST /{team_id}/boards`
- **Authentication**: ✅ Correct - Bearer token format
- **Team ID Format**: ✅ Correct - Using team.id from user object
- **Required Fields**: ❌ **ISSUE FOUND** - `project_id` marked as **required** in API docs but **optional** in our schema

## The Fix

### Changes Made

1. **Updated createBoardSchema** (`src/tools/boards.ts:15-19`):

   ```typescript
   // BEFORE
   project_id: z
       .string()
       .optional()
       .describe("Project ID to associate the board with"),

   // AFTER
   project_id: z
       .string()
       .describe("Project ID to associate the board with (required for board creation)"),
   ```

2. **Updated Tool Description** (`src/tools/boards.ts:469-470`):

   ```typescript
   // BEFORE
   description: "Creates a new board within a specified workspace (team_id)";

   // AFTER
   description: "Creates a new board within a specified workspace (team_id). Requires a valid project_id - use get_project or list_projects to find available project IDs.";
   ```

## Impact

- **Before**: Board creation failed with 403 error due to missing required `project_id`
- **After**: Board creation should work when `project_id` is provided
- **User Experience**: Claude will now prompt users to provide a project_id and suggest using get_project/list_projects tools

## Testing

- ✅ Development server starts without errors
- ✅ Code formatting applied
- ✅ Schema validation updated

## Next Steps

1. Test board creation with valid project_id
2. Verify error handling for invalid project_ids
3. Confirm integration with get_project/list_projects tools

## API Documentation Reference

- **Official Docs**: https://superthread.com/docs/api-docs/boards/create-a-board
- **Required Fields**: `project_id` (string), `title` (string)
- **Endpoint**: `POST https://api.superthread.com/v1/{team_id}/boards`
